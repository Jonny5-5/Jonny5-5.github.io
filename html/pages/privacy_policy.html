            <h3>Collecting Personal Information:</h3>
            <p class="px-5">De Gaston Apps, LLC. ("we" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This
                privacy
                policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile applications
                ("apps").</p>

            <p class="px-5">When you use our apps, we may collect information for analytics, including device
                information like
                device type and operating system, usage data that tracks how you interact with our apps, and performance
                data to enhance the app's quality and functionality. We also collect data to deliver personalized ads
                within our apps, which may include advertising identifiers and information about app usage. Please note
                that we do not sell your personal information to third-party advertisers, and any data shared with
                advertising partners is used for ad personalization within our apps.</p>

            <p class="px-5">Some of our apps may request access to your device's microphone for specific
                functionalities, like voice
                recording, tuners, or text-to-speech. We only access your microphone with your explicit permission,
                and your audio data is not stored or shared. Additionally, any personal information
                you choose to provide, such as when creating an account or interacting with us, is used
                to enhance your experience and for communication and support purposes. We take data security seriously
                and implement industry-standard measures to protect your information, ensuring your privacy while using
                our apps.</p>


            <h3>Consent to Use of Data:</h3>
            <p class="px-5">Technical data is recorded, such as app version, device version, and stack traces when the
                app crashes. This is provided by Google Play Services and Apple and used to drive future update
                decisions for the app.</p>

            <p class="px-5">You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information - including but
                not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals
                - that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, produce support, and
                other services to you. We may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally
                identify you, to improve our app and to provide far better services or technologies to you.</p>


            <h3>Sharing your Personal Information:</h3>

                personal information with third parties. Your personal data is safeguarded, and we respect your
                confidentiality.</p>

            <p class="px-5">In some instances, advertising identifiers may be employed, but only in an anonymous and
                non-identifiable manner. The sole purpose of using these identifiers is to enhance your user experience
                by delivering more relevant content and advertisements. These identifiers do not compromise your
                personal information, ensuring that your privacy remains intact throughout your interaction with our
                apps.</p>

            <p class="px-5">You may opt out of this information at any time through your phone's settings. We primarialy
                use Google Ad Ids which you can opt out of through Google.</p>

            <p class="px-5">We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at our discretion. We encourage our users
                to visit this page regularly to remain informed about any changes. By using our apps, you acknowledge
                and agree that it is your responsibility to periodically review this privacy policy and stay informed
                about any modifications. We are committed to keeping you informed about how your data is handled and
